# Phase-2-Code-Challenge-Bot-Battlr
This project, I’’ll be building out a React application that displays a list of available bots, among other things as explained below.It will implement a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react.
## Description
**This is a __ React mini web app__ that performs the tasks indicated below.**
  ###
- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
  ###
 - Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
  ###
 - Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the `YourBotArmy` component.
  ###
  - Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
